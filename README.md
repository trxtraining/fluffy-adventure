# Bad Haiku Generator - A TRX Coding Challenge

# The Problem
You and a coworker of yours want to make a haiku generator. It’s not expected to be any good at all; it’s more like a joke for when someone’s bored and wants to trigger something on Slack. 

Your coworker has provided a CSV of a thousand words in English that he wants to use (`words.csv`). Your job is to take works from that set, parse them to understand how many syllables they have, and assemble a haiku (3 lines, with 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively). Besides the haiku format, you want to avoid using duplicate words.

On counting syllables, we know English is weird and can have a lot of exceptions. Don't spend hours on being exhaustive.

You may implement this in any language of your choosing, but we'd prefer to see your Python skills. If you have time to add whatever you'd need to deem this "production-ready", we'd love to see that as well!

Fork this repository and share a link to your completed work when you're done.
